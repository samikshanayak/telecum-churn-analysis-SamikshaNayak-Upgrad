# Churn-Prediction-Analysis
Customer retention is as crucial as customer acquisition when it comes to increasing revenue. Also we know, it is much more expensive to sign in a new client than keeping an existing one.
It is advantageous for telecom companies to know what leads a client towards the decision to leave the company. Also churn prediction allows companies to develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible so we have 3 tasks:

a) Analyze the customer churn rate for bank because it is useful to understand why the customers leave.
b) Predictive behavior modeling i.e. to classify if a customer is going to churn or not.
c) Choose the most reliable model that will attach a probability to the churn to make it easier for customer service to target right customer in order to minimize their efforts to prevent churn.
